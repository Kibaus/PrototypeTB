# Unity_TitansBane
**A Prototype Vertical Slice Demo Project**
*This project currently follows as a solo project, I'd be interested in creating a solid team when I have something to showcase*


# High Concept
Titans Bane is a 3d isometric narrative based game where players will follow the narrative of the game seeking out secret treasures to trade for powerful weapons, and allies.
The narrative of this game is not solidified yet and can/will be updated as the game is being developed. At some points in the narrative when the player has to make decisions, 
they will be aloted the decision in an interactive narrative scene cut. Players explore the caverns of the deadly titans, gather treasure trades, meet new allies and conjure 
their bravery to send end the armageddon spread infection of war and destruction caused by the warlord titans!


# Game Pillars
1. Narrative Driven - Players will follow the narrative of the game and discover secrets, side-lore and scrolls (game-based history) - I want the game to follow a narrative plot (this game has been planned for development since 2019)
2. Multitasking Combat - Following treasure trades the players will make with NPCs in safe-zones, players will be able to purchase and upgrade special abilities and combos, allowing players to gain the upper hand on the battlefield during gameplay combat 
3. Wave Based AI Combat - In the narrative as follows, AI will play a crucial role to re-act as the narrative titan's minions. This is crucial for players entering new areas, as they dive deeper into the caverns, all areas down to the trenches and
tombs are protected by AI.


# Key Features
**Special Abilities**
1. Ground Slash
2. Chain Aura (Chain Lightning)
3. Time Slow (Fast Character Combat and dashes)


**Special Combos**
1. Alpha Strike - Players by default are allowed 2 dashes to evade combat | This special combo can be unlocked in gameplay allowing the player (To dash into enemies dealing a deadly blow of several slashes, instantly knocking down enemies in a chain based path)
2. Summon Aura - When players meet allies, they can summon them during combat to either protect you or join side by side to kill enemies (This combo can be upgraded so the allies combine with your Alpha Strike special)
3. StoneWall Reflector - Acts like a massive shield that consumes special combo stamina to grant the player with damage immunity for a full round (This special can be upgraded to last 2 rounds + Can be upgraded to give the player a resurrection after death on the battleield)
